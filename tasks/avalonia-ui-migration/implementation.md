## Rollback Plan

### If Migration Fails
1. **Stop Development**: Halt migration work immediately
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine what can be salvaged
3. **WPF Maintenance**: Continue with WPF version improvements
4. **Alternative Solutions**: Consider other cross-platform frameworks
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document issues for future attempts

### Partial Success Scenarios
1. **Single Platform Success**: Ship Avalonia version for working platforms
2. **Feature Subset**: Ship with core features, add advanced features later
3. **Parallel Development**: Maintain both WPF and Avalonia versions
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Use Avalonia for new features only

### Risk Mitigation During Implementation
1. **Regular Checkpoints**: Evaluate progress at end of each phase
2. **Backup Strategy**: Keep WPF version fully functional
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Test with limited user base first
4. **Rollback Triggers**: Define clear criteria for stopping migration
5. **Communication Plan**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress and issues
