# IntellisenseTextBox Testing - Plan

## Objective
Create comprehensive test coverage for the IntellisenseTextBox component to ensure reliability, maintainability, and proper functionality of the autocompletion feature.

## Scope

### Included
- Fix existing failing tests (14 tests currently failing)
- Add unit tests for all public methods and properties
- Add integration tests for TaskList interaction
- Add UI interaction tests for keyboard navigation and text insertion
- Add error handling and edge case tests
- Implement proper test infrastructure with temporary file management

### Excluded
- Performance testing (can be added later)
- UI automation testing (beyond basic interaction)
- Cross-platform specific testing
- Accessibility testing

## Approach

### High-Level Strategy
1. **Fix First**: Address the root cause of failing tests (TaskList file dependency)
2. **Build Foundation**: Establish proper test infrastructure
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Add tests for all major functionality
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure tests are maintainable and reliable

### Testing Philosophy
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the component does, not how it does it
- **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
- **Clarity**: Tests should be readable and serve as documentation
- **Reliability**: Tests should be stable and not flaky

## Components

### Files to Modify
1. **`src/TodoTxt.Avalonia.Tests/IntellisenseTextBoxUnitTests.cs`**
   - Fix existing test setup
   - Add new test methods
   - Improve test organization

2. **`src/TodoTxt.Avalonia.Tests/TodoTxt.Avalonia.Tests.csproj`**
   - Add any required test dependencies
   - Update test configuration if needed

### Files to Create
1. **Test Data Builders** (if needed)
   - Helper classes for creating test TaskList instances
   - Test data factories for consistent setup

2. **Test Utilities** (if needed)
   - Common test setup/teardown utilities
   - Mock objects for testing

## Dependencies

### External Libraries
- **NUnit**: Already included (v4.0.1)
- **Avalonia**: For UI control testing
- **System.IO**: For temporary file management

### Internal Dependencies
- **ToDoLib**: TaskList class for autocompletion data
- **TodoTxt.Avalonia**: The component under test
- **TodoTxt.Shared**: Common extensions

### Test Infrastructure
- Temporary file creation and cleanup
- Test data setup and teardown
- Event simulation for UI testing

## Risks

### Technical Risks
1. **File System Dependencies**: TaskList requires real files, making tests more complex
2. **UI Testing Complexity**: Avalonia controls may require proper initialization context
3. **Event Handling**: TextChanged and keyboard events are complex to test reliably
4. **Cross-Platform Issues**: File paths and line endings may vary between platforms

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Temporary Files**: Use proper temporary file management with cleanup
2. **Test Isolation**: Ensure each test is independent and doesn't affect others
3. **Mocking**: Consider mocking TaskList for pure unit tests where appropriate
4. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios to ensure graceful degradation

### Project Risks
1. **Time Investment**: Comprehensive testing requires significant time
2. **Maintenance Overhead**: More tests mean more maintenance
3. **Test Complexity**: UI tests can be brittle and hard to maintain

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Phased Approach**: Implement tests in phases, starting with most critical
2. **Quality Focus**: Write maintainable tests that serve as documentation
3. **Selective Testing**: Focus on critical paths and user-facing functionality

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] All 14 existing tests pass
- [ ] Proper test infrastructure established
- [ ] Temporary file management working

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Popup management tests (ShowPopup, HidePopup)
- [ ] Autocompletion logic tests (ShowSuggestions, UpdateFiltering)
- [ ] Basic user interaction tests (keyboard navigation, text insertion)

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Edge case tests
- [ ] Integration tests with TaskList
- [ ] Case-sensitive filtering tests

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test documentation
- [ ] Test maintainability review
- [ ] Performance considerations
- [ ] Test coverage analysis

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (fix existing tests)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (core functionality tests)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (comprehensive coverage)
- **Phase 4**: 1 day (quality assurance)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 days

## Assumptions
1. The IntellisenseTextBox component is stable and won't change significantly during testing
2. The TaskList class behavior is well-defined and consistent
3. Avalonia UI testing patterns are established and reliable
4. The existing test framework (NUnit) is sufficient for all testing needs
