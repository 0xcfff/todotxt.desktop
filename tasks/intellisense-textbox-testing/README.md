# IntellisenseTextBox Testing Task

## Overview
This task focuses on creating comprehensive test coverage for the IntellisenseTextBox component, a custom Avalonia UI control that provides autocompletion functionality for todo.txt projects, contexts, and priorities.

## Current Status
- **Existing Tests**: 14 tests (all currently failing)
- **Root Cause**: TaskList constructor automatically loads files, making testing difficult
- **Solution**: Fix TaskList architecture to support in-memory creation
- **Priority**: High - component needs reliable test coverage

## Task Structure

### Documentation Files
- **`research.md`**: Detailed analysis of the component, existing tests, and technical constraints
- **`plan.md`**: High-level strategy, scope, approach, and risk assessment
- **`implementation.md`**: Detailed implementation steps, testing strategy, and rollback plans
- **`README.md`**: This overview and task summary

### Key Findings
1. **Component Complexity**: IntellisenseTextBox has rich functionality including popup management, autocompletion logic, and user interaction handling
2. **Architectural Issue**: TaskList constructor automatically loads files, violating separation of concerns and making testing difficult
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Missing tests for core functionality like popup management, autocompletion logic, and user interactions
4. **Technical Challenges**: UI testing complexity, event handling, and the need for proper TaskList architecture

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix TaskList Architecture and Test Infrastructure (2-3 days)
- Fix TaskList constructor to not automatically load files
- Add parameterless constructor for in-memory creation
- Make ReloadTasks() public and handle empty _filePath gracefully
- Add LoadFromFile(string filePath) method for explicit file loading
- Establish in-memory TaskList creation for testing
- Get all 14 existing tests passing

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Tests (2-3 days)
- Add popup management tests
- Add autocompletion logic tests
- Add basic user interaction tests

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (2-3 days)
- Add error handling tests
- Add edge case tests
- Add integration tests

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance (1 day)
- Test organization and documentation
- Coverage analysis and review
- Final validation

## Success Criteria
- TaskList architecture fixed with proper separation of concerns
- All existing tests pass
- 30+ comprehensive tests covering all major functionality
- 80%+ code coverage
- Tests serve as component documentation
- Maintainable and reliable test suite

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve the plan
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation
3. Iterate based on findings and user feedback
4. Complete all phases systematically

## Related Files
- **Component**: `src/TodoTxt.Avalonia/Controls/IntellisenseTextBox.cs`
- **Existing Tests**: `src/TodoTxt.Avalonia.Tests/IntellisenseTextBoxUnitTests.cs`
- **Dependencies**: `src/TodoTxt.Lib/TaskList.cs` (needs architectural fix), `src/TodoTxt.Shared/`

## Notes
- This is a C#/.NET project using Avalonia UI framework
- Tests use NUnit framework
- Component is part of a todo.txt desktop application
- Focus on behavior testing rather than implementation details
- **Key Architectural Change**: TaskList constructor should not perform I/O operations
